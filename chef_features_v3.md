# 👨‍🍳 Chef Dashboard: Phase 3 Proposals

Here are some unique features to make the system even smarter:

### 1. 🗑️ Waste Management Log
**What:** A button to log wasted food (e.g., "Burnt", "Dropped", "Wrong Order").
**Why:** Helps track losses. If 5 Naans are burnt today, the owner needs to know!

### 2. 🏆 Chef Leaderboard (Gamification)
**What:** A "Top Chef" section showing who completed the most orders today.
**Why:** Motivates the staff to work faster and more efficiently.

### 3. 🗣️ Language Toggle (Hindi/English)
**What:** Switch the entire interface to Hindi.
- "Pending" -> "बकाया"
- "Cooking" -> "पक रहा है"
- "Ready" -> "तैयार है"
**Why:** Very helpful if some kitchen staff are not comfortable with English.

### 4. 📝 Custom Notes from Waiters
**What:** Display special instructions in **BOLD RED** text on the order card.
- Examples: "No Onion", "Extra Spicy", "Allergy: Peanuts".
**Why:** Critical for customer satisfaction and safety.

### 5. 🖨️ Thermal Printer Support (WebUSB)
**What:** Connect a USB thermal printer and print a KOT receipt with one click.
**Why:** Professional kitchens still love paper backups.

**Recommendation:**
- **Language Toggle** and **Custom Notes** are super practical.
- **Waste Log** saves money.
- **Leaderboard** is fun.
