# Chef Dashboard Feature Proposals

Here are some impactful features we can add to the Chef Dashboard to improve kitchen efficiency:

### 1. 🔔 Sound Alerts
**What:** Play a distinct chime (e.g., "Ding!") whenever a new order arrives.
**Why:** Chefs are busy cooking and might not be looking at the screen constantly. A sound ensures they never miss a new ticket.

### 2. ⏱️ Delayed Order Indicators (Color Coding)
**What:** Change the card border color based on wait time:
- **Green:** < 10 mins
- **Yellow:** 10-20 mins
- **Red:** > 20 mins (Critical)
**Why:** Helps chefs prioritize orders that are running late at a glance.

### 3. 🚫 "Out of Stock" Quick Toggle
**What:** A button on the dashboard to quickly mark an item as "Sold Out" (e.g., if they run out of paneer).
**Why:** Prevents customers from ordering items that can't be made, reducing refunds and frustration.

### 4. 📜 Order History / Recall
**What:** A "History" tab to view completed orders from the last hour.
**Why:** If a chef accidentally marks an order as "Ready", they can go back and undo it.

### 5. 🖨️ KOT Printing (Kitchen Order Ticket)
**What:** A button to print a physical ticket if a thermal printer is connected.
**Why:** Some chefs still prefer pinning a paper ticket to the pass.

**Recommendation:** I suggest starting with **Sound Alerts** and **Delayed Order Indicators** as they provide the most immediate value for a busy kitchen.
