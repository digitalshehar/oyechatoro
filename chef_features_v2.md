# 🚀 Chef Dashboard: Advanced Feature Proposals

To take the Kitchen Display System (KDS) to the next level, here are some advanced features we can implement:

### 1. 📊 Kitchen Performance Analytics
**What:** A "Stats" tab showing:
- **Average Prep Time:** How long it takes to clear an order.
- **Busiest Hours:** When the kitchen is under the most pressure.
- **Top Items:** Which dishes are being ordered the most today.
**Why:** Helps the owner/manager optimize staffing and kitchen flow.

### 2. 📺 TV / Big Screen Mode
**What:** A specific view mode designed for a large wall-mounted TV.
- **Features:** Huge fonts, high contrast, auto-scrolling if there are too many orders.
**Why:** Allows the entire kitchen staff to see orders from a distance without crowding around a tablet.

### 3. 📖 Recipe Cards
**What:** Tap on an item name (e.g., "Butter Chicken") to open a popup showing:
- **Ingredients List**
- **Portion Sizes**
- **Plating Instructions**
**Why:** Extremely helpful for new staff or trainees to ensure consistency.

### 4. 🔀 Station Routing (Multi-Screen)
**What:** Filter orders by "Station".
- **Example:** One screen for "Tandoor", one for "Chinese", one for "Curry".
**Why:** In a large kitchen, the Tandoor chef only needs to see Naans and Kebabs, not Noodles.

### 5. 🔔 Waiter Paging System
**What:** When a chef marks an order as "Ready", it triggers a specific alert on the Waiter/POS dashboard saying "Table 5 Food Ready!".
**Why:** Reduces food sitting on the pass getting cold.

**Recommendation:**
- **TV Mode** is great if you plan to mount a screen.
- **Analytics** is great for management.
- **Recipe Cards** are great for food quality control.
